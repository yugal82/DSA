What is recusrion?
-> When a function calls itself until a certain base condition is met is called recursion.

eg: 
count = 0;
void print(){
    if(count == 4)
        return;

    cout<<count;
    count++;

    print();
}

Base condition is an important part of recursion that needs careful considerations.
If we dont mention the appropriate base condition, the function call goes into an infinite loop causing STACK OVERFLOW or SEGMENTATION FAULT error.
